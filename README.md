# dataQueryingFromOlympicsHistoryData
These three files contain sql queries to fetch data from the famous olymics history dataset from Kaggle , following a tutorial on youtube from a channel called techTFQ 
I solved some of the queries using different approach than the one used in the tutorial 

sportPlayedInEverySummerGame>>>>> fetch sports that were played in all summer games ( query number 6 )
goldSilverBronzePerCountry>>>>> fetch number of medals won by every country in all games ( query number 14 )
mostMedalsPerGame>>>>>>> identifying which country won most gold, most silver and most bronze medals in each olympic games ( query number 16 )
